**Strengths:**
- **Leadership and Collaboration**: One of my key strengths is my ability to lead teams and foster a collaborative environment. Whether it's cross-functional communication or mentoring junior team members, I have always prioritized creating a cohesive and motivated team. This has been evident during my time at ASM, where I successfully led test automation migration efforts while ensuring my team was engaged and aligned with project goals.
- **Test Automation Expertise**: With a strong background in tools like Playwright, Selenium WebDriverIO, and Cucumber, I have been able to streamline test processes, increase automation coverage, and improve overall efficiency. My experience in integrating automation with CI/CD pipelines further strengthens my technical skills.
- **Problem-Solving**: I have a proactive approach to identifying and solving problems, which helps in delivering high-quality results, even under tight deadlines. Whether it's optimizing automation scripts or troubleshooting complex issues in test environments, I focus on finding effective solutions quickly.

**Weakness:**
- **Delegation**: In the past, I’ve found myself being overly hands-on with certain tasks, particularly in technical areas like test automation. This sometimes limited my ability to focus on broader team strategy and leadership.
  
**Steps Taken to Overcome Weakness:**
- I’ve actively worked on improving my delegation skills by assigning tasks more effectively and trusting team members to handle areas independently. I now make a conscious effort to empower my team by assigning ownership and responsibility to individuals based on their strengths. This shift has allowed me to focus more on strategic leadership and mentoring.

**Quality Liked by Team Members:**
- **Mentorship and Support**: My team has appreciated my willingness to mentor and provide guidance. I’m always available to help them troubleshoot issues, share knowledge, or encourage them to take on new challenges. This was particularly evident during the migration project at ASM, where I led training sessions on Playwright and created a supportive learning environment.

**Quality They Didn’t Like:**
- **Over-Involvement**: In earlier stages of my leadership roles, some team members felt that I was too involved in the details, particularly in areas where they could have handled tasks independently. This sometimes led to slower decision-making in minor areas.

By focusing on better delegation and trusting my team more, I’ve been able to address this and allow them to grow while maintaining oversight of the overall project.
