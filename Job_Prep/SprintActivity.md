As an automation tester, your sprint activities would focus on the automation aspects of the testing process within the sprint. Here are the key activities you would undertake throughout the sprint:
1. Sprint Planning and Understanding Requirements
You would participate in sprint planning meetings with the development team, test manager, product owner, and business analysts to understand the sprint goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, and any technical constraints. [1, 2]
Your primary focus is to identify which user stories or features are suitable for automation. This involves considering factors like:
The stability of the feature
The complexity of the test scenarios
The reusability of the automation scripts
The return on investment (ROI) of automation [3]
2. Test Design and Automation Framework Setup
Once the user stories for automation are identified, you would collaborate with developers to understand the technical implementation of the features and identify potential areas that require focused testing. [3]
You would design and develop robust and maintainable automation scripts based on the acceptance criteria and test scenarios. This involves:
Choosing the appropriate automation framework and tools, such as Selenium WebDriverIO or Playwright. [4]
Designing a modular and scalable framework that allows for easy script maintenance and expansion.
Writing clear and concise test scripts that are easy to understand and debug.
3. Test Automation Development and Execution
You would develop automated tests for regression testing, functional testing, and API testing, focusing on the user stories identified for automation. [4]
You would integrate the automated tests into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure tests run automatically after each code commit. Tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions can be used for this purpose. [4, 5]
As developers complete their work and check in code, the CI pipeline triggers the automated tests. You would monitor the test results and work with developers to resolve any failures quickly. [6]
You would also perform manual testing for new features or areas not suitable for automation, such as exploratory testing. [4]
4. Defect Management and Reporting
You would log any defects found during testing in a defect tracking system like Jira. These defects would be categorized, prioritized, and assigned to developers for resolution. [6]
You would work closely with developers to ensure that critical defects are addressed quickly and that no high-priority bugs remain unresolved within the sprint. [6]
5. Continuous Improvement and Collaboration
You would participate in sprint retrospectives to discuss the challenges faced during testing and suggest improvements to the testing process, automation framework, or team collaboration. [7]
You would continuously evaluate and improve the automation framework to enhance its efficiency, reliability, and maintainability.
You would stay updated with the latest testing tools and technologies to ensure the team uses the best practices.
6. Release and Monitoring
After the release, you may be involved in post-release testing in the production environment to ensure the stability of the build. [7]
You would also monitor the system for any issues that arise post-release. [7]
In addition to these core activities, you might also contribute to performance testing using tools like K6 to ensure the system meets performance benchmarks. [6]
Remember, as an automation tester, your goal is to ensure the quality of the software by automating repetitive and critical test scenarios and integrating them into the CI/CD pipeline. This allows for faster feedback, earlier defect detection, and increased efficiency in the overall development process.
