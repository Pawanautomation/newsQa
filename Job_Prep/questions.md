3)What makes a good test leader? can you share from your own experiences of working in previous companies like Blue-zinc,ASM etc 
A good test leader is someone who not only ensures the technical quality of the software but also inspires and guides the team towards continuous improvement. From my experience at Blue Zinc and ASM, I believe there are a few key qualities that make a strong test leader:
Technical Expertise and Strategic Vision: At Blue Zinc, I led the end-to-end automation testing using Playwright and TypeScript, optimizing the existing frameworks to improve test coverage and efficiency. A good leader needs to have hands-on technical skills, but also the strategic vision to enhance processes, ensuring that the testing strategy aligns with broader business goals.
Collaboration and Communication: In my role at ASM, I worked closely with cross-functional teams, incorporating both manual and automated testing strategies. I made it a priority to facilitate open communication between developers, testers, and stakeholders, ensuring that everyone was aligned on project requirements and quality standards.
Mentorship and Team Development: One of the most rewarding aspects of leadership is mentoring team members. At ASM, I focused on training junior engineers, sharing best practices in automation, and creating an environment where they felt supported to grow professionally. By helping others improve their skills, I was able to create a strong, self-sufficient team.
Adaptability and Problem-Solving: As a test leader, I was also responsible for adapting to evolving project needs. For example, during my time at ASM, I migrated existing scripts from WebDriverIO to Playwright to take advantage of modern features, demonstrating the need for leaders to stay agile and continuously improve.
These experiences have taught me that a good test leader balances technical skills, clear communication, and the ability to inspire and mentor their team while keeping a strategic eye on the long-term objectives.




3)**Tell me about yourself and why you would be a good Test Manager for L3Harris.**

"With over 8 years of experience in automation and manual testing, I’ve led QA efforts across complex software systems, particularly using Playwright, Selenium WebDriverIO, and TypeScript. My expertise spans test automation, API testing, accessibility testing, and integrating these processes into CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins and Docker. 

What sets me apart as a Test Manager is my focus on building efficient, scalable automation frameworks and leading teams with a strong emphasis on collaboration and continuous improvement. I’ve successfully mentored junior engineers, streamlined test processes to reduce manual effort by over 50%, and improved test coverage significantly.

At L3Harris, with its focus on flight safety and cutting-edge technologies, I see a perfect alignment with my passion for innovation and quality. I’m excited by the opportunity to contribute to a global leader in aviation by bringing my skills in test management, leadership, and automation to enhance both safety and operational efficiency." 

This response highlights your experience, leadership, and alignment with L3Harris’s goals while keeping the answer brief and human-like.

4)What are your values as a company leader? What's your leadership style? 
As a company leader, my core values center around openness, collaboration, and fostering innovation.

Engaging and appreciating the team’s efforts is key to maintaining motivation and driving continuous improvement.
I also value inclusivity—ensuring every voice is heard and that diversity of thought is encouraged within the team. Innovation thrives when team members feel trusted and supported, and I strive to build a culture where creativity and problem-solving are celebrated. Lastly, I prioritize transparency and open communication to maintain trust and alignment within the team, which I believe is crucial for achieving long-term success


5)What qualities and attributes make a good leader?
A good leader possesses a unique blend of qualities and attributes that inspire, motivate, and guide their team toward success. Here are some key characteristics:
Strategic Vision: A strong leader has a clear and compelling vision for the future. They can articulate this vision to their team, inspiring them to work towards a common goal.
Planning and Organization: Effective leaders are excellent planners and organizers. They can set goals, develop strategies, and allocate resources efficiently to achieve desired outcomes.
Responsibility and Accountability: A good leader takes ownership of their actions and the results of their team. They are accountable for the company's performance and are willing to take responsibility for both successes and failures.
Organizational Awareness: Leaders must have a deep understanding of the organization's culture, values, and goals. This awareness allows them to make informed decisions and navigate complex situations effectively.
Leadership by Example: One of the most powerful leadership qualities is the ability to lead by example. By demonstrating the behaviors and values they expect from their team, leaders can inspire trust, respect, and followership.
Positive Role Model: A good leader is a positive role model who inspires others to reach their full potential. They create a supportive and inclusive environment where team members feel valued and motivated to succeed.
I believe I possess these qualities and attributes, and I am confident in my ability to lead a team effectively. I have a proven track record of planning, organizing, and taking responsibility for company results. 

4)Are you a risk taker?
I believe that taking calculated risks is essential for driving progress and innovation. While I am not someone who takes unnecessary risks, I do believe that well-thought-out risks, when backed by solid research and risk assessments, can lead to significant rewards. In my experience, it's important to weigh the potential benefits against the risks, analyze the data, and understand the possible outcomes before making a decision.
For example, during my time at ASM, I led the migration of our automation framework from WebDriverIO to Playwright. This was a significant change that involved risks, such as the potential for downtime and the learning curve for the team. However, after assessing the advantages, such as improved performance and better handling of dynamic content, I decided to move forward. The result was a more efficient testing process and better long-term outcomes for the team.
So yes, I do take risks, but only after careful consideration and with contingency plans in place to mitigate any potential downsides.

5)How do you develop a strong and positive company culture? 
Developing a strong and positive company culture is key to boosting both productivity and employee satisfaction. I believe that fostering open communication, promoting collaboration, and encouraging continuous improvement are at the heart of building such a culture.
One of the ways I promote a positive culture is by ensuring that team members feel valued and heard. Regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and open discussions are great tools to build trust and make employees feel that their contributions matter. At ASM, I prioritized a collaborative environment where everyone, from junior testers to senior engineers, could share ideas and contribute to the decision-making process. This inclusivity not only helped improve our work but also enhanced team morale.
Encouraging continuous improvement is another cornerstone of positive culture. I’ve always pushed for ongoing learning and development, providing opportunities for team members to upskill and take on new challenges. For example, I regularly led training sessions to keep the team updated on new tools and testing methodologies, fostering a sense of growth and engagement.
By creating an environment where feedback is welcomed, accomplishments are recognized, and employees have opportunities to grow, you cultivate a culture where people are motivated and excited to contribute. This directly leads to higher productivity and satisfaction across the board.

6) What's your longterm goal?

My long-term goal is to be part of a company where I can make valuable contributions while fostering both my personal and the company’s growth. I’m looking for a long-term, meaningful association where I can evolve with the organization. As I advance, I aim to take on more strategic responsibilities, shaping the direction of quality assurance and playing a key role in the company’s overall success.
