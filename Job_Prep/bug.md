As a tester, you raised a bug but the developer disagrees. What will you do?

Response:

When a developer disagrees with a reported bug, it's important to approach the situation professionally and collaboratively. Here are some steps I would take:

Gather Evidence: Gather as much evidence as possible to support the bug report. This may include screenshots, error logs, test cases, and any relevant documentation.
Reproduce the Bug: Try to reproduce the bug with the developer present. This can help to clarify any misunderstandings and ensure that both parties are seeing the same issue.
Communicate Clearly: Explain the bug in clear and concise terms, using specific examples and data to support your claim. Be open to listening to the developer's perspective and understanding their reasoning.
Collaborate: Work together with the developer to investigate the issue further. If necessary, involve other team members or experts to get a second opinion.
Escalate if Necessary: If the disagreement persists, escalate the issue to a more senior member of the team or project manager. They can help to mediate the situation and ensure that the bug is resolved.
Document the Issue: Clearly document the bug, including the steps to reproduce it, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. This will help to track the issue and ensure that it is resolved.
It's important to maintain a professional and respectful attitude throughout the process. By working together and communicating effectively, we can resolve the issue and ensure the quality of the product.

When you raise a bug and the developer disagrees, it's important to approach the situation professionally and collaboratively. Here’s how I would handle it:

### 1. **Revalidate the Bug:**
   - First, I would **recheck the bug** to ensure it is valid. This includes reproducing the issue with clear steps and verifying the environment in which the bug occurred. If the issue persists, I would capture screenshots, logs, or videos to provide strong evidence.
   
### 2. **Provide Detailed Information:**
   - I would ensure that the bug report includes **detailed, objective information**, such as:
     - Steps to reproduce.
     - Expected vs. actual behavior.
     - Environment details (e.g., browser version, OS).
     - Supporting evidence like logs, error messages, and test results.
   - This detailed information can help the developer better understand the context of the issue.

### 3. **Collaborative Discussion:**
   - I would reach out to the developer for a **one-on-one discussion**. Instead of framing it as a confrontation, I’d take a collaborative approach, asking them to help me understand why they think it’s not a bug and share my perspective on why I raised it.
   - For example, I might say, *"I see you're not experiencing the same issue, but from my end, this is what I’m seeing. Could we go through it together and figure out what might be causing the discrepancy?"* This opens up a dialogue and encourages cooperation.

### 4. **Involve a Third Party (if needed):**
   - If we are unable to reach a consensus, I would involve a **third party**, like a QA lead, a product owner, or a business analyst. These stakeholders can provide additional context about the feature's requirements or help mediate the disagreement.

### 5. **Refer to Documentation:**
   - I would refer to the **specification or acceptance criteria** of the feature. If the reported behavior deviates from what was documented, I would use the documentation as a reference to support the validity of the bug.

### 6. **Log the Disagreement:**
   - If the developer still disagrees after providing evidence, I would log the bug in our tracking system (like JIRA) as **“under discussion”** or **“needs clarification.”** This ensures there is a record of the disagreement and that the issue is not lost or forgotten.

### 7. **Escalation (if necessary):**
   - If the bug affects the critical functionality of the product and the disagreement continues, I would **escalate the issue** to the QA or project manager, emphasizing the potential risks of not addressing the bug.

By taking a collaborative approach, focusing on clear communication and evidence, and involving relevant stakeholders when necessary, you can effectively manage disagreements with developers in a productive manner.
