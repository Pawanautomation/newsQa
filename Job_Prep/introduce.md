Hello Gill and Sean, thank you for having me today. I have over 8 years of experience in manual and automation testing software. I specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript, and I have extensive hands-on experience building and optimizing automation frameworks using Playwright, Cucumber BDD, and WebDriver IO. Throughout my career, I have focused on ensuring the highest quality of software, working closely with developers, business analysts, and product owners in Agile/Scrum environments.

Iâ€™ve worked across various industries, and have been fortunate to contribute to some interesting projects. For instance, at Blue Zinc, I led end-to-end automation testing using Playwright and TypeScript and also handled accessibility testing using Axe to ensure WCAG compliance. Additionally, at ASM, I optimized existing frameworks and migrated automation scripts from WebDriverIO to Playwright, significantly improving test coverage and efficiency.
